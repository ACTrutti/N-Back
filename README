About N-Back

Single N-Back
The n-back task is a Continuous Performance Task that is commonly used in 
neuroimaging to stimulate brain activity in test subjects. It was introduced 
by Wayne Kirchner in 1958.

The subject is presented with a sequence of stimuli, and the task consists of 
indicating when the current stimulus matches the one from n steps earlier in 
the sequence. [1]

Dual N-Back
The dual-task n-back task was proposed by Susanne Jaeggi et al. in 2003.
In this variation, two independent sequences are presented simultaneously, 
typically using different types of stimuli, such as one auditory and one visual. [1]

A 2008 research paper claimed that practicing a dual n-back task can increase 
fluid intelligence (Gf), as measured in several different standard tests. [1]

The 2008 study was replicated in 2010 with results indicating that practising 
single n-back may be almost equal to dual n-back in increasing the score on 
tests measuring Gf. [1]
